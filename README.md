# CVESearch
Query various sources for CVE proof-of-concepts

Many vendors and references provide no proof-of-concept or working exploit for CVEs. This utility was created to automate searching for proof-of-concepts.

There is currently support for:
* Exploit Database
* cvebase
* GitHub

The GitHub search requires a personal access token is created and set to the GITHUB_KEY environment variable.
